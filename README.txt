`Param`_ is a library providing Parameters: Python attributes extended
to have features such as type and range checking, dynamically
generated values, documentation strings, default values, etc., each of
which is inherited from parent classes if not specified in a subclass.

Please see http://ioam.github.com/param/ for more information.

Installation
============

Param has no dependencies outside the standard library, and can be
installed via ``easy_install param`` or ``pip install
param``. Alternatively, Windows users can download and run the exe;
others can download and unpack the source tar.gz, and then install
with a command like ``python setup.py install`` (e.g. ``sudo python
setup.py install`` for a site-wide installation, or ``python setup.py
install --user`` to install into ``~/.local``).
