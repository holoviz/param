    "In the [Dependencies and Watchers](Dependencies_and_Watchers.ipynb) guide we discovered how to express dependencies and write callback functions that are invoked when parameter values change. This low-level, imperative style of expressing dynamic behavior is powerful, and works well for capturing complex behaviors in self-contained Parameterized classes with methods and Parameters. But even if you are not primarily designing a hierarchy of classes, it is still useful to be able to express dependencies between values and computations. Param 2.0 introduces a new set of declarative dynamic computation primitives that are useful even for single expressions, letting you write simple reactive functions and expressions that are re-evaluated automatically when required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reactive programming model is one you might be familiar with from spreadsheets like Excel, where formulas can reference cells or ranges and dynamically (or more precisely, _reactively_) recompute when the inputs to a formula changes. In Param, Parameter objects correspond to a spreadsheet cell formula's inputs or references, and reactive expressions correspond to the formula itself. `param.bind` also allows the creation of a reactive function with arbitrary inputs.\n",

    "- The Python `is` statement always checks the immediate identity of its two operands, and so it cannot be deferred  reactively\n",

    "- No overloading is available for control flow keywords like `if`, `elif`, and `else` or ternary conditional expressions (i.e. `a if condition else b`), and so those actions cannot be captured for later reactive execution\n",
    "- Iteration keywords like `for` or `while` can only be overloaded to some extent, specifically for fixed length collections; other types of iteration cannot be captured for later reactive execution\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you work around these limitations, a reactive expression provides alternative ways of doing those operations, using methods on a special namespace `.rx` to avoid confusion with the underlying object's own methods.
