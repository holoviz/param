    "Param 2.0 introduces a declarative, reactive model. Reactive expressions automatically update when their referenced Parameters change. This model encourages you to specify 'what' should happen, letting Param manage 'how,' thereby simplifying code logic and enhancing modularity. Unlike the 'push' model, which may require complex event orchestration, the reactive model emphasizes high-level relationships. This makes it versatile, scaling from simple to complex use cases. For instance, the reactive model is a good fit in data transformation pipelines and real-time dashboards, automatically updating dependent steps or visualizations when underlying Parameters change. The reactive approach allows you to focus on defining the transformation or relationship logic without worrying about the sequence of updates.\n",

The underlying mechanism leverage's Python's [operator overloading](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operator-overloading-in-python/), which allows us to redefine common operators like '`+`' to perform additional tasks. When you use these operators in reactive expressions, Param not only carries out the operation but also records it, establishing a dependency from the reactive variables involved to the resulting expression. This means that when a reactive variable is updated, Param automatically updates any expressions dependent on it.\n",

    "Without `rx()`, adding 1 to `i` would have immediately invoked integer addition in Python, assigning an integer 2 to `j`. However, because we made `i` a reactive expression, what happens is that `i` stores its input value on an internal attribute called `_obj`, while overloading `+` to not just calculate `i + 1`, but also return another reactive object that records the operation (`i + 1`). This stores the dependency so that whenever `i` changes, the reactive object knows that it needs to update itself by re-executing `i + 1`."

    "\n",
    "- Python requires the `len` operation to return an integer, not a deferred reactive integer\n",
    "- The Python `is` statement always checks the immediate identity of its two operands, so it cannot be deferred  reactively\n",
    "- Logical operators like `and`, `or`, `not`, and `in` are required to return Boolean types rather than deferred, reactive Boolean types\n",
    "- No overloading is available for control flow keywords like `if`, `elif`, and `else` or ternary conditional expressions (i.e. `a if condition else b`), and so those actions cannot be captured for later reactive execution\n",
    "- Iteration keywords like `for` or `while` can only be overloaded to some extent, specifically for fixed-length collections; other types of iteration cannot be captured for later reactive execution\n",

    "- `.rx.when()`: Generates a new expression that only updates when the provided dependency updates.\n",
    "- `.rx.where()`: Returns either the first or the second argument, depending on the current value of the expression.\n",

This can sometimes make it challenging to isolate specific parts of a pipeline for debugging or performance optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter `param.bind`, which allows you to define functions that are automatically invoked when their input Parameters change. This serves as a bridge between the reactive `rx` model and the lower-level 'push' model. Unlike the 'push' model, where you would explicitly set up watchers and callbacks, `param.bind` simplifies the process by letting Param manage the mechanics, but also making the dependencies more transparent than in a purely `rx` approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, `param.bind` offers the declarative nature of reactive expressions and the explicitness of the 'push' model. This makes it particularly useful for complex applications where you might want the clarity of explicit function calls for key parts of your pipeline, but also wish to retain the high-level, declarative relationships offered by reactive expressions.\n",
