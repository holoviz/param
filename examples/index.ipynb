    "# Comparison to other packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Param was first developed in 2003, in the context of the Topographica brain simulator project, and\n",
    "was made into a separate package in 2012.  In the interim other parameter libraries were\n",
    "developed, including [Traits](http://code.enthought.com/projects/traits) and \n",
    "[Traitlets](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/).  These libraries have broadly similar goals,\n",
    "but each differs in important ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependencies**: \n",
    "  Traits is a much more heavyweight solution, requiring \n",
    "  installation of a large suite of tools, including C code, which makes it difficult to include in \n",
    "  separate projects.  In contrast, Param and Traitlets are both pure Python projects, with minimal dependencies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**GUI toolkits**: \n",
    "  Although any of the packages could in principle add support for any\n",
    "  GUI toolkit, the toolkits actually provided differ: Traits (via the\n",
    "  separate TraitsUI package) supports wxWidgets and QT, while Param\n",
    "  supports Tkinter (via the separate ParamTk package) and\n",
    "  browser-based IPython widgets (via the separate ParamNB package),\n",
    "  while Traitlets only supports IPython widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "     >>> from time import time\n",
    "     >>> import traitlets as tr\n",
    "     >>> class A(tr.HasTraits):\n",
    "     ...     instantiation_time = tr.Float()\n",
    "     ...     @tr.default('instantiation_time')\n",
    "     ...     def _look_up_time(self):\n",
    "     ...         return time()\n",
    "     ... \n",
    "     >>> a=A()\n",

    "     >>> b.instantiation_time\n",
    "     1475587164.750875\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic values**:\n",
    "  Param, Traits, and Traitlets all allow any Python expression to be\n",
    "  supplied for initializing parameters, allowing parameter default\n",
    "  values to be computed at the time a module is first loaded.  Traits\n",
    "  and Traitlets also allow a class author to add code for a given\n",
    "  parameter to compute a default value on first access.  Param does\n",
    "  not provide any special support for programmatic default values,\n",
    "  instead allowing fully dynamic values for *any* numeric Parameter\n",
    "  instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  >>> from time import time\n",
    "  >>> import param\n",
    "  >>> class A(param.Parameterized):\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Note that here it is the *user* of a Parameterized class, not the\n",
    "  author of the class, that decides whether any particular value is\n",
    "  dynamic, without writing any new methods or other code.  All the\n",
    "  usual type checking, etc. is done on dynamic values when they are\n",
    "  computed, and so the rest of the code does not need to know or care\n",
    "  whether the user has set a particular parameter to a dynamic value.\n",
    "  This approach provides an enormous amount of power to the user,\n",
    "  without making the code more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**On_change callbacks**\n",
    "  Traitlets and Traits allow the author of a HasTraits-derived class\n",
    "  to specify code to run when a specific parameter used in that class\n",
    "  instance is modified.  Param supports similar capabilities, but not\n",
    "  at the Parameterized class level, only at the Parameter class level\n",
    "  or as part of ParamNB.  I.e., a class author needs to first write a\n",
    "  new Parameter class, adding methods to implement checking on\n",
    "  changes, and then add it to a Parameterized class, or else such\n",
    "  functionality can be added as callbacks at the whole-object level,\n",
    "  using ParamNB. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages, and\n",
    "  per-parameter on_change callbacks could be added in the future if\n",
    "  there are clear use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these packages also overlap in functionality with Python\n",
    "properties, which were added to the language after Traits and Param\n",
    "were developed.  Like parameters and traits, properties act like\n",
    "attributes with possible method-like actions, and so they can all be\n",
    "used to provide the same user-visible functionality.  However,\n",
    "implementing Param/Traits-like functionality using properties would\n",
    "require vastly more code (multiple method definitions for *every*\n",
