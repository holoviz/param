    "As outlined in the [Dynamic Parameters](Dynamic_Parameters.ipynb) guide, Param can be used in multiple ways, including as a static set of typed attributes, dynamic attributes that are computed when they are read (`param.Dynamic` parameters, a \"pull\" or \"get\" model), and using explicitly expressed chains of actions driven by events at the Parameter level (a \"push\" or \"set\" model described in this notebook). \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Dynamic Parameters, which calculate values when parameters are _accessed_, the dependency and watcher interface allows events to be triggered when parameters are _set_. With this interface, parameters and methods can declare that they should be updated or invoked when a given parameter is modified, spawning a cascading series of events that update settings to be consistent, adapt values as appropriate for a change, or invoke computations such as updating a displayed object when a value is modified. This approach is well suited to a GUI interface, where a user interacts with a single widget at a time but other widgets or displays need to be updated in response. The\n",

Next, if someone chooses a different continent, the list of countries allowed needs to be updated, so the method `_update_countries()` that (a) looks up the countries allowed for the current continent, (b) sets that list as the allowed objects for the `country` parameter, and (c) selects the first such country as the default country.\n",
    "3. Finally, we expressed that the `_update_countries()` method depends on the `continent` parameter. We specified `watch=True`) to direct Param to invoke this method immediately, whenever the value of `continent` changes. We'll see [examples of watch=False](#watch=False-dependencies) later. Importantly we also set `on_init=True`, which means that when instance is created the `self._update_countries()` method is automatically called setting up the `country` parameter appropriately. This avoids having to declare a `__init__` method to manually call the method ourselves and the potentially brittle process of setting up consistent defaults."

    "1. **Multiple dependencies**: Here we had only one parameter in the dependency list, but you can supply any number of dependencies (`@param.depends('continent', 'country', watch=True)`).\n",
    "2. **Dependencies on nested parameters**: Parameters specified can either be on this class, or on nested Parameterized objects of this class. Parameters on this class are specified as the attribute name as a simple string (like `'continent'`). Nested parameters are specified as a dot-separated string (like `'handler.strategy.i'`, if this object has a parameter `handler`, whose value is an object `strategy`, which itself has a parameter `i`). If you want to depend on some arbitrary parameter elsewhere in Python, just create an `instantiate=False` (and typically read-only) parameter on this class to hold it, then here you can specify the path to it on _this_ object.\n",
    "3. **Dependencies on metadata**: By default, dependencies are tied to a parameter's current value, but dependencies can also be on any of the declared metadata about the parameter (e.g. a method could depend on `country:constant`, triggering when someone changes whether that parameter is constant, or on `country:objects` (triggering when the objects list is replaced (not just changed in place as in appending). The available metadata is listed in the `__slots__` attribute of a Parameter object (e.g. \n",
    "`p.param.continent.__slots__`). \n",
    "4. **Dependencies on any nested param**: If you want to depend on _all_ the parameters of a nested object `n`, your method can depend on `'n.param'` (where parameter `n` has been set to a Parameterized object).\n",
    "5. **Dependencies on a method name**: Often you will want to break up computation into multiple chunks, some of which are useful on their own and some which require other computations to have been done as prerequisites. In this case, your method can declare a dependency on another method (as a string name), which means that it will now watch everything that method watches, and will then get invoked after that method is invoked.\n",

The asynchronous approach is then only needed for very specific applications where you want your code to be decoupled from an external system.
