    "# Dynamic parameter values\n",
    "\n",
    "When developing your own Python code using Parameters, there are a variety of different programming models you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parameters as fancy Python attributes**: making use of Param's semantic type checking, inheritance of default values and docstrings, etc., but not using any dynamic or event-handling features of Param. When Parameter values need to change, users change them explicitly, using their own Python code in separate methods and functions invoked from outside of Param.\n",
    "2. **\"Push\" model**: Using Param's [Dependencies and Watchers](Dependencies_and_Watchers.ipynb) so that Param invokes user-written code to change Parameter values based on events that Param detects (typically chaining from changes in some other parameter values). A \"push\" model is typical for event-driven GUI applications, where a user interacts with a GUI widget to change some Parameter value, prompting Param to execute chained dependencies in response.\n",
    "3. **\"Pull\" model**: Using Dynamic parameter values (described here) where the value of each dynamic parameter is computed when the parameter is read, potentially computing it from some global state values. A \"pull\" model is typical for simulations with a global clock, making it easy to use value _a1_ at time 1, value _a2_ at times 2-100, value _a3_ for 100-, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these models has advantages and disadvantages that make them appropriate for different situations, so it's important to understand all three models so that you can choose the right one(s) for your system. Here, we'll discuss the third model, using `Dynamic` parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `param.Dynamic`\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Dynamic` parameter of type `t` is one that accepts _either_ a value of type `t`, _or_ a callable returning a value of type `t`. If a user passes a callable, the callable will be invoked to get the actual value when the parameter value is accessed. All of Param's numeric parameter types are `Dynamic` because their base class `param.Number` inherits from `param.Dynamic`. New non-numeric types can be defined and made dynamic by inheriting from `param.Dynamic`, and having dynamic string and selector parameters would be a nice addition to the current dynamic numeric parameter support. \n",

Without Dynamic support and numbergen, your Parameterized classes could of course provide their own support for e.g. a normal random distribution by accepting a mean and variance, but it would then be limited to that specific random distribution, whereas Dynamic parameters can accept _any_ current or future number generator object as configured by a user for their own purposes, neatly separating your Parameterized's requirements (\"a positive integer value\") from the user's requirements (\"let's see what happens when the value starts at 1 and doubles every iteration\").\n",

All current `TimeAware` NumberGenerator objects are random number generators that support both possible values of `time_dependent`. For `time_dependent=False` (the default), they return a new value on each call, while for `time_dependent=True`, they return pseudorandom values that follow the indicated distribution but are also a strict function of the time, in that the same number will be returned for a given time value even if time skips ahead or backwards. \n",

    "Notice that the decision to use a particular distribution is up to the _user_ of class `P`, not the author of `P`. The author of `P` just needs to know that `i` will be an integer and that `x` will be a float (with bounds if specified); the user is then free to set those values to be static or any type of dynamic value as needed. Using Param with this \"pull\" model thus provides users with easy ways to control how parameters change their value over time (for some model of time), without additional work by the Parameterized class author. You can see extensive examples of this approach at the [imagen](https://imagen.holoviz.org) website, which shows how Numbergen objects can be used to create flexible streams of generated image objects without needing any special support for such streams in the Parameterized objects in that library."
