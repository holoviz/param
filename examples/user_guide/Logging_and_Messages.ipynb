    "# Logging and Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "`Parameterized` objects provide methods for displaying messages, warnings, and other output in a way that can be controlled and redirected globally using the standard Python [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) module (see the [logging cookbook](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html)). Compared to using a Python logger directly, using these methods inside your Parameterized class helps users by making the messages consistent, each prepending with information about the instance where the call was made.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, a Python logger named `param` will be instantiated to do the logging, but another logger can be supplied by setting `param.parameterized.logger` to it after importing `param.parameterized`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing log messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Each logging message has an associated logging `level` that indicates how severe a condition is being described (DEBUG, VERBOSE, INFO (aka \"message\"), WARNING, ERROR, or CRITICAL). These levels are as defined by the logging module, except for the addition of VERBOSE as a level intermediate between DEBUG (internal debugging information) and INFO (user-relevant non-error messages).\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical way to print a message is to call one of the following methods, each accepting the same arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.param.debug()`: Detailed debugging information, not displayed onscreen by default.\n",
    "- `.param.verbose()`: Additional sometimes-useful information, not displayed onscreen by default.\n",
    "- `.param.message()`: Informative message, displayed onscreen by default.\n",
    "- `.param.warning()`: Warning of an unexpected or inappropriate but non-fatal condition, displayed onscreen by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "The arguments accepted are the same as those of [logging.debug()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.debug). Specifically, each call is like `.param.debug(msg,*args,**kw)`, where `msg` is an [old-style ('%') format string](https://wiki.python.org/moin/StringFormatting) and the `args` and `kwargs` will be merged with that format string.

    "The answer is that particularly for `debug` and `verbose` messages that could occur inside frequently executed code, we want logging to be \"lazy\", in that we do not want to render a string representation for `actual`, `desired`, etc. unless we are actually printing the message. If we use an f-string or any other locally formatted string, the string formatting will be done _whether_ _or_ _not_ the message will be displayed, potentially causing drastic slowdowns in your code. For instance, in the code above, the entire `locals()` dictionary would be iterated over, printed to strings. Of course, since the message isn't being printed in that case, the entire format string would then be discarded, greatly slowing down the code without producing any output. So, even though it is more awkward, it is highly recommended to use this old-style, lazy string formatting support."
