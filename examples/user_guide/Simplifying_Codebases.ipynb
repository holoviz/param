    "\n",
    "If you think about the examples above, you can see how Param makes it simple for programmers to make a contract with their users, being explicit and clear what will be accepted and rejected, while also allowing programmers to make safe assumptions about what inputs the code may ever receive. There is no need for `__call__` _ever_ to check for the type of one of its parameters, whether it's in the range allowed, or any other property that can be enforced by Param. Your custom code can then be much more linear and straightforward, getting right to work with the actual task at hand, without having to have reams of `if` statements and `asserts()` that disrupt the flow of the source file and make the reader get sidetracked in error-handling code. Param lets you once and for all declare what this code accepts, which is both clear documentation to the user and a guarantee that the programmer can forget about any other possible value a user might someday supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, these contracts apply not just between the user and a given piece of code, but also between components of the system itself. When validation code is expensive, as in ordinary Python, programmers will typically do it only at the edges of the system, where input from the user is accepted. But expressing types and ranges is so easy in Param, it can be done for any major component in the system.  The Parameter list declares very clearly what that component accepts, which lets the code for that component ignore all potential inputs that are disallowed by the Parameter specifications, while correctly advertising to the rest of the codebase what inputs are allowed. Programmers can thus focus on their particular components of interest, knowing precisely what inputs will ever be let through, without having to reason about the flow of configuration and data throughout the whole system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without Param, you should expect Python code to be full of confusing error checking and handling of different input types, while still only catching a small fraction of the possible incorrect inputs that could be provided. But Param-based code should be dramatically easier to read, easier to maintain, easier to develop, and nearly bulletproof against mistaken or even malicious usage. "
