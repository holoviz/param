Parameters are a kind of class attribute allowing special behavior,

strings, constant and read-only parameters, and type or range checking
at assignment time.

Potentially useful for any large Python program that needs
user-modifiable object attributes; see the Parameter and Parameterized
classes for more information.  If you do not want to add a dependency
on external code by importing from a separately installed param
package, you can simply save this file as param.py and copy it and
parameterized.py directly into your own package.

This file contains subclasses of Parameter, implementing specific
parameter types (e.g. Number), and also imports the definition of
Parameters and Parameterized classes.

class Time(Parameterized):
    """
    A callable object returning a number for the current time.

    Here 'time' is an abstract concept that can be interpreted in any
    useful way.  For instance, in a simulation, it would be the
    current simulation time, while in a turn-taking game it could be
    the number of moves so far.  The key intended usage is to allow
    independent Parameterized objects with Dynamic parameters to
    remain consistent with a global reference.

    The time datatype (time_type) is configurable, but should
    typically be an exact numeric type like an integer or a rational,
    so that small floating-point errors do not accumulate as time is
    incremented repeatedly.

    When used as a context manager using the 'with' statement
    (implemented by the __enter__ and __exit__ special methods), entry
    into a context pushes the state of the Time object, allowing the
    effect of changes to the time value to be explored by setting,
    incrementing or decrementing time as desired. This allows the
    state of time-dependent objects to be modified temporarily as a
    function of time, within the context's block. For instance, you
    could use the context manager to "see into the future" to collect
    data over multiple times, without affecting the global time state
    once exiting the context. Of course, you need to be careful not to
    do anything while in context that would affect the lasting state
    of your other objects, if you want things to return to their
    starting state when exiting the context.

    The starting time value of a new Time object is 0, converted to
    the chosen time type. Here is an illustration of how time can be
    manipulated using a Time object:

    >>> time = Time(until=20, timestep=1)
    >>> 'The initial time is %s' % time()
    'The initial time is 0'
    >>> 'Setting the time to %s' % time(5)
    'Setting the time to 5'
    >>> time += 5
    >>> 'After incrementing by 5, the time is %s' % time()
    'After incrementing by 5, the time is 10'
    >>> with time as t:  # Entering a context
    ...     'Time before iteration: %s' % t()
    ...     'Iteration: %s' % [val for val in t]
    ...     'Time after iteration: %s' % t()
    ...     t += 2
    ...     'The until parameter may be exceeded outside iteration: %s' % t()
    'Time before iteration: 10'
    'Iteration: [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]'
    'Time after iteration: 20'
    'The until parameter may be exceeded outside iteration: 22'
    >>> 'After exiting the context the time is back to %s' % time()
    'After exiting the context the time is back to 10'

    forever = Infinity()

    label= String(default='Time', doc="""
         The label given to the Time object. Can be used to convey

        Callable that Time will use to convert user-specified time
        values into the current time; all times will be of the resulting
        numeric type.

        By default, time is of integer type, but you can supply any
        arbitrary-precision type like a fixed-point decimal or a
        rational, to allow fractional times.  Floating-point times are
        also allowed, but are not recommended because they will suffer
        from accumulated rounding errors.  For instance, incrementing
        a floating-point value 0.0 by 0.05, 20 times, will not reach
        1.0 exactly.  Instead, it will be slightly higher than 1.0,
        because 0.05 cannot be represented exactly in a standard
        floating point numeric type. Fixed-point or rational types
        should be able to handle such computations exactly, avoiding
        accumulation issues over long time intervals.

        Some potentially useful exact number classes:

         - int: Suitable if all times can be expressed as integers.

         - Python's decimal.Decimal and fractions.Fraction classes:
           widely available but slow and also awkward to specify times
           (e.g. cannot simply type 0.05, but have to use a special
           constructor or a string).

         - fixedpoint.FixedPoint: Allows a natural representation of
           times in decimal notation, but very slow and needs to be
           installed separately.

         - gmpy.mpq: Allows a natural representation of times in
           decimal notation, and very fast because it uses the GNU
           Multi-Precision library, but needs to be installed
           separately and depends on a non-Python library.  gmpy.mpq
           is gmpy's rational type.

class Number(Dynamic):
    """
    A numeric Dynamic Parameter, with a default value and optional bounds.

    There are two types of bounds: ``bounds`` and
    ``softbounds``.  ``bounds`` are hard bounds: the parameter must
    have a value within the specified range.  The default bounds are
    (None,None), meaning there are actually no hard bounds.  One or
    both bounds can be set by specifying a value
    (e.g. bounds=(None,10) means there is no lower bound, and an upper
    bound of 10). Bounds are inclusive by default, but exclusivity
    can be specified for each bound by setting inclusive_bounds
    (e.g. inclusive_bounds=(True,False) specifies an exclusive upper
    bound).

    Number is also a type of Dynamic parameter, so its value
    can be set to a callable to get a dynamically generated
    number (see Dynamic).

    When not being dynamically generated, bounds are checked when a
    Number is created or set. Using a default value outside the hard
    bounds, or one that is not numeric, results in an exception. When
    being dynamically generated, bounds are checked when the value
    of a Number is requested. A generated value that is not numeric,
    or is outside the hard bounds, results in an exception.

    As a special case, if allow_None=True (which is true by default if
    the parameter has a default of None when declared) then a value
    of None is also allowed.

    A separate function set_in_bounds() is provided that will
    silently crop the given value into the legal range, for use
    in, for instance, a GUI.

    ``softbounds`` are present to indicate the typical range of
    the parameter, but are not enforced. Setting the soft bounds
    allows, for instance, a GUI to know what values to display on
    sliders for the Number.

    Example of creating a Number::

      AB = Number(default=0.5, bounds=(None,10), softbounds=(0,1), doc='Distance from A to B.')
