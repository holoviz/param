Provide consistent and up-to-date ``__version__`` strings for Python
packages.

It is easy to forget to update ``__version__`` strings when releasing
a project, and it is important that the ``__version__`` strings are
useful over the course of development even between releases,
especially if releases are infrequent.

This file provides a Version class that addresses both problems.
Version is meant to be a simple, bare-bones approach that focuses on
(a) ensuring that all declared version information matches for a
release, and (b) providing fine-grained version information via a
version control system (VCS) in between releases.  Other approaches
like versioneer.py can automate more of the process of making
releases, but they require more complex self-modifying code and code
generation techniques than the simple Python class declaration used
here.

Currently, the only VCS supported is git, but others could be added
easily.

To use Version in a project that provides a Python package named
``package`` maintained in a git repository named ``packagegit``:

1. Make the Version class available for import from your package,
   either by adding the PyPI package "param" as a dependency for your
   package, or by simply copying this file into ``package/version.py``.

2. Assuming that the current version of your package is 1.0.0, add the
   following lines to your ``package/__init__.py``::

     from param import Version
     __version__ = Version(release=(1,0,0), fpath=__file__,
                           commit="$Format:%h$", reponame="packagegit")

   (or ``from .version import Version`` if you copied the file directly.)

3. Declare the version as a string in your package's setup.py file, e.g.::

     setup_args["version"]="1.0.0"

4. In your package's setup.py script code for making a release, add a
   call to the Version.verify method. E.g.::

     setup_args = dict(name='package', version="1.0.0", ...)

     if __name__=="__main__":
          if 'upload' in sys.argv:
              import package
              package.__version__.verify(setup_args['version'])
          setup(**setup_args)

4. Tag the version of the repository to be released with a string of
   the form v*.*, i.e. ``v1.0.0`` in this example.  E.g. for git::

     git tag -a v1.0.0 -m 'Release version 1.0.0' ; git push


Now when you run ``setup.py`` to make a release via something like
``python setup.py register sdist upload``, Python will verify that the
version last tagged in the VCS is the same as what is declared in the
package and also in setup.py, aborting the release until either the
tag is corrected or the declared version is made to match the tag.
Releases installed without VCS information will then report the
declared release version.  If VCS information is available and matches
the specified repository name, then the version reported from
e.g. ``str(package.__version__)`` will provide more detailed
information about the precise VCS revision changes since the release.
See the docstring for the Version class for more detailed information.

class Version(object):
    """
    A simple approach to Python package versioning that supports PyPI
    releases and additional information when working with version
    control. When obtaining a package from PyPI, the version returned
    is a string-formatted rendering of the supplied release tuple.
    For instance, release (1,0) tagged as ``v1.0`` in the version
    control system will return ``1.0`` for ``str(__version__)``.  Any
    number of items can be supplied in the release tuple, with either
    two or three numeric versioning levels typical.

    During development, a command like ``git describe`` will be used to
    compute the number of commits since the last version tag, the
    short commit hash, and whether the commit is dirty (has changes
    not yet committed). Version tags must start with a lowercase 'v'
    and have a period in them, e.g. v2.0, v0.9.8 or v0.1.

    Development versions are supported by setting the dev argument to an
    appropriate dev version number. The corresponding tag can be PEP440
    compliant (using .devX) of the form v0.1.dev3, v1.9.0.dev2 etc but
    it doesn't have to be as the dot may be omitted i.e v0.1dev3,
    v1.9.0dev2 etc.

    Also note that when version control system (VCS) information is
    used, the comparison operators take into account the number of
    commits since the last version tag. This approach is often useful
    in practice to decide which version is newer for a single
    developer, but will not necessarily be reliable when comparing
    against a different fork or branch in a distributed VCS.

    For git, if you want version control information available even in
    an exported archive (e.g. a .zip file from GitHub), you can set
    the following line in the .gitattributes file of your project::

      __init__.py export-subst
