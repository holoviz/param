"""
A simple approach to versioning that replaces the need to manually
maintain __version__ strings without requiring larger, less elegant
solutions (e.g. versioneer.py).

It is easy to forget to update __version__ strings when releasing a
project and it is important that the __version__ strings are useful
over the course of development, especially if releases are infrequent.

The Version class is designed to solve these problems, acting as a
simple version string for released versions while making additional
information accessible when working with version control during
development (currently only supports git). Here is a typical example
of how it is used:

__version__ = param.Version(release=(1,0), fpath=__file__)

The Version class assumes that you will tag the release in your
version control system with a string in the form v*.* before the
release is made. By calling the Version.verify method from setup.py,
you will be reminded to create this tag (is it has been forgotten) and
will check that all versioning information has been properly updated.

    A simple, approach to versioning that supports PyPI releases and
    additional information when working with git version control. When
    obtaining from PyPI, the version is the supplied release tuple.

    During development `git describe` will be used to compute the
    number of commits since the last version tag, the short commit
    hash and determine if the commit is dirty. Version tags must start
    with a lowercase 'v' e.g. v1.0, v2.0, v0.9.8 etc.

    Note that when git is used, the comparison operators take into
    account the number of commits since the last version tag. This
    approach is often useful in practice but may fail when using
    distributed version control across forks and branches.

    To add git archive support in your project's '__init__.py' file
    you will need to set the following line in .gitattributes:
